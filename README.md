# Timelapse-Calculator
TL;DR
A calculator to help you determine how many photos to take and how often to reach a desired video length for a time lapse.
Also includes the amount of memory that will be used.

Detailed Explanation:
Determine how long the event you want to capture will last. For example, how long do you want to record seeds sprouting?
Then determine how long you want your final video to be.
How many frames per second (fps) do you want your video?

This calculator will take that information and tell you how many photos you need to take,
at what interval (ex. take a photo every 8 seconds) to reach your desired video length. 
Based on the number of photos and the size per photo,
this calculator will also determine how much memory you will need total to create the timelapse.
